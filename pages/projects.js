                                        Loopground is my latest venture. I love building things with electrical
                                        components, but it always sucks that Sparkfun and Adafruit are ridiculously
                                        expensive. Ordering from china is a possibility but much like forrest gump's box
                                        of chocolates: you never know what you gon' get. Loopground sources pre-vetted
                                        components from china for a very good price, and with great docs. We're
                                        currently experimenting with "kits" so people can easily start building cool DIY

                                        Travelflow wanted to build a booking engine, combining flights, hotels and event
                                        tickets. As lead developer I was responsible for charting the business
                                        requirements from the employees and translating that into domain sketches. From
                                        those domain sketches, we started building an MVP and creating a team of
                                        developers. I did most of the interviews to determine developer skill, and to
                                        stay on release track. After assembling a backend team and writing a lot of C#
                                        code, I also created the requirements for the CMS in React. While not building a
                                        lot of React, I was reviewing the bulk of the PRâ€™s. We deployed the solution as
                                        a microservice landscape on AWS. Using SQS as a service bus and Fargate as a
                                        container manager.
